	<description>Matt 22, has the greatest impact, from Deut 6, greatly overlooked in history, the WHY behind WHAT God did in Creation and Redemption, circle of loving God then love ourselves then to love others, not first commandment ministry vs second commandment ministry but all are called to have first first, neither First nor Second Great Command is more important than the other, loving God is not defined by the Hippie culturefirst not more than second but in sequence, ministry hyperactivity a distraction, Jesus prayed for this, the right to copy, love God on His terms, deeply rooted in obedience, ministry is about people loving God as our FIRST purpose not only numerical growth</description>

	<title>Our Eternal Identity as a House of Prayer</title>

	<description>VERY easy to misunderstand this message, prayer is not a mere ministry focus but the eternal identity when in resurrected bodies in the New Heaven and Earth, most think prayer is important and painfully admit we don't do it much, Christians do not see it as their identity, where God speaks to our hearts and we speak to His heart, ALL ministry is a house of prayer - know it or not - or it is not God's ministry and YWAM perspective of missions, of 100 favorite verses Isaiah 42 sing a new song, prayer for nations is a call for God to come near and ultimately return, pray FOR Jesus means for His ADMINISTRATION, prayer meeting was first after the Red Sea was parted and first building commanded was for prayer, Jesus began in prayer, Acts - the Church was borne in a prayer meeting and ends in prayer and in the New Earth forever, the Word must move our heart to speak in prayer and we must declare war on everything that interrupts that process</description>

	<title>Manifestations of the Spirit – the real and the fake</title>

	<description>Family Chat about fake manifestations of the Spirit, how to respond kindly, and the need to identify it frankly. Don't always try to recreate a past experience you may have had. Don't give into peer pressure to pretend that the Holy Spirit is powerfully at work in your life just because other people do it. The Lord touching your heart is about your relationship with the Lord, not about impressing others with how anointed you supposedly are. False manifestations of the Holy Spirit coming on us can hinder our own growth in Christ and can be uncourteous toward those around us. Don't think that acting crazy will cause the Holy Spirit to fall upon you either, that's not how it works. It can be fun to yell, but don't think it's the Spirit and don't be distracting. These days, around 80 percent of all manifestations are fake and only about 20 percent are true. If the person near you is acting loud and it's obviously fake, kindly ask them not to. Misty Edwards adds her comments toward the end.</description>

	<description>God IS love by His nature, God wants us to enter into His love for us, He intended for deep fellowship with Him from the Beginning, our view of Jesus affects our view of ourselves, Heavenly reward is mutual love with God Himself, we must press-in to have the full experience God has for us, the myth of trying to eliminate ourselves as supposedly bringing us closer to Him, affection is the strongest source of obedience, Godly view of "success" that He enjoys us enjoying it, loving ourselves for His sake</description>
